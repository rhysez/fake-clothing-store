# FRESH - A fake clothing store with a function shopping cart, build with ReactJS.

This project was built to get a better grasp of react-router. The project contains three pages: Home, Shop and Cart. 
The user can browse shop items, specify an item quantity and then add those items into their cart. 
The cart page will display a list of items the user has added, as well as options to delete those items from the cart, and the total price.

This UX/UI of this project was designed by Deanna Brimson.
